# jquery.sort-by-sort-order

When you need to give users the ability to sort listing of contents, it's very likely to end up with creating 2 select elements, one for setting the attribute to sort by ("title", "total", "comments count") and another for choosing the sort order ("asc", "desc").
This solution is simple to implement, but what if you need something more intuitive for the user, without losing the semplicity of form elements?
